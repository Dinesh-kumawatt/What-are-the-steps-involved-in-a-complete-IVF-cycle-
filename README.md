A full IVF cycle includes a few clear stages:

Consultation & Testing: Blood tests, ultrasound, semen analysis

Ovarian Stimulation: Hormone injections for 8â€“12 days to produce more eggs

Egg Retrieval: A small procedure done under anesthesia to collect eggs

Fertilization in Lab: Eggs and sperm combined or ICSI is used

Embryo Culture: Embryos grow for 3â€“5 days in special incubators

Embryo Transfer: 1 or 2 embryos are placed in the uterus using a thin tube

Luteal Support: Hormone medicines are given to support pregnancy

Pregnancy Test: After 12â€“14 days, a blood test confirms if implantation happened

Every cycle is customized. Some people may have frozen embryo transfer later, and some may need PGT or donor options.

At Trinity IVF Ahmedabad, every couple is guided personally at each step, with clear communication and emotional support.
